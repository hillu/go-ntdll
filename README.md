Go interface to NTDLL functions
===============================

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-ntdll?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-ntdll)

This package makes selected `NTDLL` funcions directly available in Go
programs. At the moment, types and functions for accessing kernel
objects and the Registry are included. The goal is to, eventually,
cover all available functions.

Note
----

Please do not consider this code, particularly the autogenerated code,
as stable. Identifiers names may still be subject to change.

Basic functions, types
----------------------

NTDLL functions usually return an `NTSTATUS`, this is mapped into an
`NtStatus` type (underlying kind: `uint32`). Strings are usually
passed around as `UNICODE_STRING`, there is a type `UnicodeStringType`
for that.

Extending
---------

Function signatures and structure definitions are generated from
header file snippets as found in the MSDN. The transformation code can
be found in `mkcode.go`, it probably has bugs and does not cover all
cases.

To add more structures or function stubs or enumeration types, just
find the appropriate definition on MSDN and copy them into block
comments, prefixed by `type:`, `func:`, or `enum:`, respectively. `go
generate` can then be used to regenerate the `*_generated.go` files
containing structure definitions and the glue code around
`golang.org/x/sys/windows`.
