Go interface to NTDLL functions
===============================

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-ntdll?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/hillu/go-ntdll)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/hillu/go-ntdll)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/hillu/go-ntdll)

This package makes selected `NTDLL` functions directly available in Go
programs. At the moment, types and functions for accessing kernel
objects and the Registry are included. The goal is to, eventually,
cover all available functions.

Note
----

Please do not consider this code, particularly the autogenerated code,
as stable. Identifiers names may still be subject to change.

Basic functions, types
----------------------

NTDLL functions usually return an `NTSTATUS`, this is mapped into an
`NtStatus` type (underlying kind: `uint32`). Strings are usually
passed around as `UNICODE_STRING`, there is a type `UnicodeStringType`
for that.

Variable-Sized Arrays
---------------------

Structs that contain fields that are arrays with one (or
`ANYSIZE_ARRAY`) elements. For those fields, getters that return a
slice and setters that fill the array from a slice are generated.

Example:
``` c
typedef struct _FILE_NAME_INFORMATION {
  ULONG FileNameLength;
  WCHAR FileName[1];
} FILE_NAME_INFORMATION, *PFILE_NAME_INFORMATION;
```
is turned into
``` go
type FileNameInformationT struct {
	FileNameLength uint32
	FileName       [1]uint16
}
```
and associated methods
``` go
func (t *FileNameInformationT) FileNameSlice(size int) []uint16
func (t *FileNameInformationT) SetFileNameSlice(s []uint16)
```

Extending
---------

Function signatures and structure definitions are generated from
header file snippets as found in the MSDN. The transformation code can
be found in `mkcode.go`, it probably has bugs and does not cover all
cases.

To add more structures or function stubs or enumeration types, just
find the appropriate definition on MSDN and copy them into block
comments, prefixed by `type:`, `func:`, or `enum:`, respectively. `go
generate` can then be used to regenerate the `*_generated.go` files
containing structure definitions and the glue code around
`golang.org/x/sys/windows`.
